## INTRODUCTION

### Background
Retail and e-commerce organizations generate large volumes of transactional sales data every day across multiple product categories, customer segments, and geographic regions. However, raw datasets are often difficult to interpret directly due to their size and complexity.

Business Intelligence tools such as **Power BI** play a critical role in transforming this data into meaningful dashboards that support:

- Performance monitoring
- Strategic decision-making
- Market and customer understanding
- Profitability optimization

Interactive dashboards allow stakeholders to explore trends, identify high-performing areas, and detect issues in real time.

### Motivation
The motivation behind the project was to simulate a real-world BI analyst workflow by designing a multi-page sales performance dashboard using the Global Superstore dataset.

The project focuses on building an end-to-end reporting solution that not only visualizes sales metrices but also delivers actionable insights related to customer behavior, product profitability, shipping performance, and discount-driven revenue impact.
